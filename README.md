# ButtonChallenge

The `MainActivity` shows `EditText` fields for `name` and `email` and a `create` button to make the network request in order to create the user. Underneath, there is a `RecyclerView` that displays the list of users belonging to my `CANDIDATE_PARAMETER` **jsrr11237**. I have also added a swipe feature on the `RecyclerView` in order ot refresh the list of users. Just swipe down on the `RecyclerView` to refresh the list.
